# roboticrover
A simple robot using Arduino

Goal:   A rover that can be used by scientists for data collection or observations in environments that are not friendly to humans.


Motivation: Mars Perseverance Rover which is collecting data on its own using preloaded instructions


Achievements: The rover can be controlled smoothly using bluetooth; it can be operated in autonomous mode in a limited environment


Shortcomings: No data collection sensors and storage components  have been added yet
